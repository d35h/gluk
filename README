===========================================================================

The tar file in which you have this (README) file you will have
additional file with extentions ".c", ".l", ".h"  ".tex" and
a subdirectory named "compiler" under which there exist files
with the extension ".lsp" and some files (with no extentions)
with names starting with "comp".

The first to do is: To get a LaTeX printout of the "lispman.tex"
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are already a Utah-STD-LISP pro then we hope you will enjoy
our work.  Presumably your first wish will be getting your hands
on the interpreter, so proceed by reading the "Compiler" chapter.

If you are not familiar with Utah-STD-LISP then the first job to do
is to get the

     "Standard Lisp Report"
     by: J. B. Marti, A. C. Hearn, M. L.Griss, and C. Griss,
     Published in: SIGPLAN Notices 14, No 10 (1979) 48--68,
                   ACM, New York.

This is the description of this LISP dialect. It is NOT a LISP
tutor. If you are a novice in LISP then you need some other books.

(We believe "Standard Lisp Report" should exist in electronic form
 somewhere in the reduce-library)

possibility that some characters in the file get replaced by others in
a way which is not one-to-one. Below is a list how we see  it.
